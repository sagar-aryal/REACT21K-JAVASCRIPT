      Make a program that asks three numbers from the user. Program prints out
      sum of the numbers, if any of the numbers is positive. If all the numbers
      are positive, also print out multiplication. If all numbers are negative,
      text “only negatives” is printed. Handle zero as positive in this
      assignment.
